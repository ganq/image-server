Description:
cJSON aims to be the dumbest possible parser that you can get your job done
with.  It's a single file of C, and a single header file.
JSON is described best here: http://www.json.org/
It's like XML, but fat-free.  You use it to move data around, store things, or
just generally represent your program's state.

Local Modifications:
None

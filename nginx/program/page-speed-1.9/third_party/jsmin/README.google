Description:
JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace
from JavaScript files. It typically reduces filesize by half,
resulting in faster downloads. It also encourages a more expressive
programming style because it eliminates the download cost of clean,
literate self-documentation.

Local Modifications:
1. Ported jsmin.c to a C++ version, in the cpp subdirectory.

2. Updated license to a standard MIT license, which Douglas Crockford
   issued to us on 9/25/2009 to address some concerns about the
   standard jsmin license and its incompatibility with licensing
   requirements for certain OS distros such as Fedora. See
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=455507 for an example.

Description:
OptiPNG is a PNG optimizer that recompresses image files to a smaller
size, without losing any information. This program also converts
external formats (BMP, GIF, PNM and TIFF) to optimized PNG, and
performs PNG integrity checks and corrections.
If you wish to learn how PNG optimization is done, or to know about
other similar tools, read the PNG-Tech article "A guide to PNG
optimization".

Local Modifications:

1. opngreduc has been modified to conditionally include support for
   ancillary chunks.

2. the pngxtern GIF reader has been modified to read from in-memory
   buffers instead of FILE pointers.

3. the pngxtern API has been modified to only include support for GIF
   files.

4. a call to png_get_image_height has been inlined since not all
   versions of libpng provide this function.

5. The signature of pngx_read_gif has been changed to take a
   GIFExtension*. Previously, pngx_read_gif declared a local
   GIFExtension and later attempted to free a member of that
   GIFExtension. However, since libpng can call longjmp, this free was
   not always called. Moving memory management of the GIFExtension
   outside the function is necessary to guarantee that GIFExtension
   memory is cleaned up properly.
